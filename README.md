# CivClicker by FG
The game was strongly inspired by <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a>.

CivClicker was originally built by Katherine Stark in 2013-14. She stated she didn't intend
to develop it further, so it was then maintained by <span class="text-white">Scott Colcord</span> for part of 2014.
Since then no new updates have been made to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/civclicker/code/ci/master/tree/" target="_blank">SourceForge</a> repo,
so Luke Nickerson forked it on <a href="https://github.com/deathraygames/civ-clicker" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to make some
improvements and potentially inspire others to contribute.
                                                
In 2022, Frederic Deconinck (aka Freddec) made in a remake of the Luke's version on <a href="https://github.com/FreddecGames/civclickerbyfg" target="_blank">Github</a> too.
His goal is to make UI changes, and to improve the interface, styling, and fix some bugs. Please feel free to contribute by submitting improvements on his <a href="https://discord.com/channels/808751395661807616/1037677977011494923" target="_blank">Discord</a>.
This is this version you are playing.
